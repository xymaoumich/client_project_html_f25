        <h2>Building a Strategic Networking Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Building a clear, intentional networking plan is an essential part of career development.
            By creating a LAMP list, you can organize your outreach and focus on high-priority contacts.
            For a structured approach, see the
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HMt79BU8ovGf9z7_P7No5tuwUS6qHNW5u0sgrepLtE/edit?tab=t.0">[Handout] Creating a LAMP List for Strategic Networking</a>.
        </p>

            The <b>Intro to Making Connections Workshop</b> highlights strategies for identifying alumni,
            crafting effective outreach emails and LinkedIn messages, and sustaining professional relationships.
            It emphasizes keeping messages concise, personal, and respectful of the recipient’s time.
            The workshop also provides templates for coffee chat requests, internal referrals, and thank-you notes.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further connect with alumni, visit the
            <a href="https://umich.peoplegrove.com/v2">University Career Alumni Networking (UCAN)</a> platform,

            The <b>AI Prompt Resource Guide</b> introduces ways to use generative AI responsibly to support networking,
            from drafting outreach messages to brainstorming conversation starters.
            It includes prompt styles such as scenario, role-based, and list generation.
            For example: “Imagine you are at a networking event—how would you introduce yourself?”
        </p>
        <p>
            A strong elevator pitch is another critical tool for making connections.

        <h2>Planning an Informational Interview</h2>
        <p>
            Informational interviews are informal conversations with professionals that give you insight into industries,
            organizations, and roles. The <b>TIARA Method</b> offers a structure for your questions:
            <i>Trends, Insight, Advice, Resources, and Assignments</i>.
            A typical flow might start with light conversation, move into career-related questions,
            and end with gratitude and a follow-up thank-you email.
        </p>
        <p>
            For question examples and further detail, see the
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwq2KtdKQbO-tICHKUyKRA3QY4_3VJ8NLC2kwPBY4dI/edit?tab=t.0">

        <p>
            Career fairs provide opportunities to meet employers and practice your pitch in a fast-paced environment.
            The <b>Career Fair Prep Workshop</b> recommends registering in advance, researching employers,
            and preparing multiple copies of your resume.
            Start with lower-priority employers to practice, then approach your top choices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following up afterward is critical—send thank-you emails or LinkedIn messages within one to two days.
