        <h2>Best Practices for UMSI Resumes</h2>
        <p>
            Craft a master resume first (no page limit, for your eyes only), then tailor it down. Aim for 1 page for tech/consulting roles; up to 2 for libraries or research.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use clean fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, 10pt min) and consistent formatting—no fancy tables that break ATS.</li>
            <li>Margins 0.5in+; fill pages fully if multi-page.</li>
            <li>Contact info at top: Name, phone, email, LinkedIn/Portfolio (no full address for privacy).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Education Section</h3>
        <p>
            List first (unless 10+ years experience). Use full degree names like "Master of Science in Information (MSI), focus in UX Design" with expected graduation month/year. Add relevant coursework/projects if experience is light—e.g., "SI 501: Contextual Inquiry – Conducted user research for a startup client."
        </p>

        <h3>Experience & Leadership</h3>
        <p>
            Reverse chronological; use strong action verbs (e.g., "Led," "Optimized"). Quantify impacts: "Reduced processing time by 20% using Python scripts."
        </p>

        <h3>Skills & Other Sections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>List tools/languages (e.g., Python, Figma) and soft skills.</li>
            <li>Include certifications, online courses, or volunteer work if relevant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI Note</h3>
        <p>
            AI is great for brainstorming bullets or keyword spotting—but edit heavily for your authentic voice. Avoid uploading sensitive info; never copy-paste raw output.

        <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>

            <li><strong>Tailor for every job?</strong> Yes! Match keywords and prioritize relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Include projects/coursework?</strong> Definitely—UMSI work impresses employers.</li>
