        <h2>Before the Interview: Positioning Yourself</h2>
        <img src="images/interview0.png" alt="Interview preparation" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px; height: auto;">
        <p>The job interview is one of the most crucial steps in your career search process. It is the organization’s opportunity to determine mutual fit. Research is essential because it helps you position yourself in terms of the employer’s needs—not just what you want from the job. Understanding the organization’s mission, values, recent developments, and the role itself allows you to tailor your responses and show how your background aligns with their goals.</p>
        <p>Prepare to address the "Big Three" questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why You?</strong> Articulating a response to “Tell Me About Yourself”</li>
            <li><strong>Why This Position?</strong> Understanding the role demands through the job description and online research</li>
            <li><strong>Why This Organization?</strong> Understanding the organization and the industry</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Resources for Research:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The job description</li>
            <li>The company website—specifically the ‘About Us’ tab (look for challenges, new initiatives, or programs)</li>
            <li>If publicly traded, financial statements and other information might give you a perspective on overall goals, business philosophy, etc.</li>
            <li>News updates and—if possible—information about your interviewers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Interview: Using Frameworks</h2>
        <img src="images/interview02.jpg" alt="Interview Instruction" style="max-width: 100%; width: 600px; height: auto;">
        <p>During the interview, use structured frameworks to articulate your responses effectively. This helps build rapport and guides the conversation to highlight your strengths.</p>

        <h3>Why You? (Tell Me About Yourself)</h3>
        <p>One of the most common questions you’ll encounter is “Tell Me About Yourself.” It often serves as the opening question and sets the tone for the rest of the conversation. Focus on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Professional identity and areas of expertise</li>
            <li>Most recent position</li>
            <li>Key achievement with # scope or result</li>
            <li>Degrees, job titles, relevant skills</li>
            <li>Passion for role</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example Structure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I’m a [list professional identity], with expertise in [list three core skills as identified in description].</li>
            <li>Most recently with [list current or previous role and company].</li>
            <li>I’m proud of the fact that [list most recent accomplishment with metrics].</li>
            <li>A little on my background [list degrees, additional credentials or experience].</li>
            <li>I'm really excited for the opportunity to make contributions to [tie back to current needs/team].</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why This Position / Organization / Industry?</h3>
        <p>Interviewers want to understand your motivation and fit. Use the Assertion and Proof framework: Make a confident statement about your interest, then back it up with specific examples or experiences.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Why do you want to work in healthcare operations improvement?</p>
        <p><strong>Assertion:</strong> I have been interested in operations improvement and healthcare ever since I was a child.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> I still remember trying to speed up patient intake processes as I watched my mom volunteer as a nurse at a major church conference. I love figuring out the best and most efficient way to do things, and provide the best service. My Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certification project at Michigan Medicine was a highlight for me that combined my analytical strengths and my values in seeing how improved medical services changed people’s lives and health for the better.</p>

        <h2>Following Up After the Interview</h2>
        <p>A thoughtful follow-up can leave a lasting impression. Here’s how to do it effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Send a Thank-You Note:</strong> Within 24 hours, email a personalized thank-you note to each interviewer, reiterating your interest and referencing specific discussion points.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflect on the Interview:</strong> Note what went well and areas for improvement to prepare for future interviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Patient but Proactive:</strong> Follow up politely if you haven’t heard back within the timeline provided (typically 1-2 weeks).</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> Keep track of multiple interview processes, including dates and contacts, to avoid confusion.</li>
        </ul>
